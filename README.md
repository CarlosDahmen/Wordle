# Wordle

A clone of the popular game Wordle created by Josh Wardle. The purpose of this app was to implement context/context providers as the main state management tool in an app.

The game logic is implemented in a custom react hook, and the app is wrapped in a context provider that allows it access to the variables in the hook state.

## Technologies used

- Context/Context provider
- React Hooks

The project was built using create-react-app

## How to run the app:

    On the main project folder
